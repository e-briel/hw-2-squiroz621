I am unable to figure out the issues with loading Numpy when running your code in the Binder badge. I was able to run it fine after forking it and opening it under your ligo environment in Jupyter Hub, so I'm not sure why it wasn't operational via the Binder since you do have the environment.yml file available in the repo. I suspect it could have something to do with how your files were committed or pushed together into the Github repo, but I'm not well versed enough in the code to suggest a proper solution to this.
